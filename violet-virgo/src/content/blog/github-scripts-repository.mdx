As I continue to revamp this blog and move more and more of the content into a source controlled environment it seemed sensible to move the various scripts that still exist in the blog to a location where I can track their changes and improve them over time.

I have created a new public repository under my Github account which stores the scripts and as I work out how to handle releases I will tweak and update the scripts to encompass changes since they were originally written.

You can check out the repo here [Scripts](https://github.com/MattWhite-personal/Scripts)

If you think there are changes required in the scripts to resolve functionality or update it with the latest changes to how the script should execute then you can raise an issue or propose a change directly in Github.
